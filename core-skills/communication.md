A big part of our day to day work is about communicating effectively with others. This is extremely important because the overall process of building a product requires harmony between people and a clear understanding of everyone’s role in what’s being built.

Here are some reasons why effective communication is important:

- Building great software is hard 
- It avoids confusion
- It provides purpose
- It creates accountability
- It saves time and eventually money 
- It builds trust 

Oftentimes, engineers focus only on learning about new technologies and neglect improving their ability to communicate with their co-workers. Achieving the proper balance between technical ability and strong communication skills is the difference between a good developer and a great one.
