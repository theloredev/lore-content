# Introduction

Communication is an essential skill that directly influences the success of all projects involving more than one person. As a software engineer, lacking communication skills will hold you back. Conversely, **excellent communication skills may be the secret sauce needed to launch your career**.

In this article, we will:

- Build our understanding of communication - first generally and then at a deeper level.
- Providing the information you need to hone your communication skills.
- Cement those skills by exploring real-life scenarios in which communication makes the difference between mediocre results and glowing success.

# What is Communication?

Communication is the tool we use to share our thoughts, feelings, and concerns with others. Effective communication allows the free-flow of information and ideas.

Most engineers focus on technical skills. To become a great engineer, however, top notch communication skills are essential.

**Strong communication is the foundation of collaboration.** Communication enables teamwork by facilitating mutual understanding, engagement, brainstorming, and creativity.

# Why is Communication Important?

*“No man is an island.”*

- John Donne

In our personal lives as well as at work, communication is critical on a daily basis. All of the strongest friendships, relationships, and teams are established and nourished by solid communication.

But let’s get more specific. Communication is critical because it:

- **Avoids confusion**: Every person thinks differently with their own unique perspective. Communication allows us to understand each other and get on the same page.
- **Clarifies purpose**: Even when the goals of a project are clear, important aspects like priorities, methods, and expectations can be subtly different from person to person. Effective communication brings people together with a unified purpose.
- **Creates accountability**: Who, exactly, is responsible for what? With stunted communication, individual roles toward achieving shared goals are easily misunderstood.
- **Saves time and minimizes costs**: Misunderstandings often result in lost time and money. Great communication conserves resources.
- **Builds trust**: Effective communication bolsters relationships with a shared sense of understanding. Teams can achieve so much more when their members believe and trust one another.

# How Does Communication Work?

To understand communication on a deeper level, we’ll break it down and examine its basic components:

- Senders and Receivers
- Encoding and Decoding
- Barriers

Practically speaking, every instance of communication can be compared to a simple text message sent from one person to another. **Like a text message, all communication involves senders, receivers, encoding, and decoding**.

Additionally, it’s critical to understand barriers. Successful communication requires identifying and overcoming any barriers present.

## Senders and Receivers

Communication always occurs between senders and receivers. While multiple senders may work together to send unified messages we can say that on the most basic level, any singular moment of communication comes from individual senders.

Although communication is transmitted by individual senders, the number of receivers of communication is limitless. Let’s see some examples:

- A supervisor speaks to a team member. The *supervisor* is the *sender* and the team member is the receiver.
- An engineer presents a concept at a team meeting with five listeners. The *engineer* is the *sender* and the five listeners are five receivers.
- Two engineers explain the results of their project at a team meeting with five listeners. Although the engineers are working together to communicate, they are communicating separately as *two individual senders* to the five listeners as receivers.

## Encoding and Decoding

Encoding is the process by which senders formulate and send their messages. Decoding is the process by which receivers deconstruct and understand messages. Encoding and decoding are the most complicated parts of communication and absolutely critical for successful communication to take place. We’ll examine them individually.

### Encoding

As a sender, how can you make your message clear enough to be understood by its receivers? The answer is effective encoding. Effective encoding requires:

- **A clear vision of the message you want to send**. “*Think before you speak.*” To make yourself understood to others, you must be crystal clear about what, exactly, you’re trying to communicate.
- **Anticipating your receiver(s) ability to decode your message**. Especially when you’re trying to communicate intricate ideas, you need to be aware of your receiver(s) limitations. For example, complex coding concepts should be simplified when they’re explained to people without prior coding experience.
- **The expression of your message in a simple yet adequate manner**. The longer and more complicated your message is, the more likely it is to be misunderstood. For this reason, ideal communication requires condensing and clarifying without losing any necessary information.
- **Acknowledgment and overcoming of any existing communication barriers**. What, if anything, is likely to impair your receiver(s) ability to understand your message? Identifying and conquering barriers is critical. (More on this in the next section.)

If all of this sounds difficult and complicated, rest assured that most of it becomes automatic with practice and experience. The key is to know that each of the steps in the encoding process is important for successful communication.

### Decoding

Decoding is done by the receivers. In many ways, it is the mirror image of the encoding process. At this point, a critical point must be made:

While we often think of communication as something that’s being done - aka the message being sent - receivers play just as vital as a role. Communication is a two-way process; to be a great communicator, you need to learn to receive messages, as well.

As the mirror image of encoding, the process of decoding involves:

- **Actively receiving the sent message. If the message is verbal, this means listening carefully. If it’s in text form, we’re talking about reading carefully. Regardless of the type of message, though, actively receiving is about giving the sender and their message your full attention.**
- **Consideration of the sender’s perspective. A great deal of miscommunication is the result of neglecting this step. To properly decode messages, it helps to consider things like:**
    - The sender’s knowledge of what’s being communicated.
    - The sender’s emotional state.
    - Any biases the sender might have.
- **Acknowledgment and overcoming of any existing communication barriers. Is anything preventing you from fully decoding the sender’s message? If so, play your part in identifying and conquering barriers.**

## Barriers

In a perfect world, senders and receivers would encode and decode their messages flawlessly, resulting in effortless communication. In the real world, however, encoding and decoding are almost always impacted by some sort of barrier(s).

**A communication barrier is anything that impedes the processes of encoding and/or decoding**. In the most difficult cases, barriers totally inhibit communication, making it impossible for senders and receivers to understand each other. Most of the time, though, communication barriers are smaller and less obvious.

In any given instance of communication, a number of invisible barriers may be present, subtly decreasing the effectiveness and efficiency of messages between senders and receivers.

Let’s take a look at some different types of communication barriers:

- **Physical**. Literal barriers to communication exist when two people talk on either side of a door, for example, making it impossible to read body language.
- **Verbal. Verbal barriers to communication are things like language differences and vocabulary limitations.**
- **Cultural: Even when two people speak the same language, misunderstandings in meaning may arise when they are from different cultures. For example, someone unfamiliar with the phrase, “Don’t let the cat out of the bag,” may wonder why there’s a cat in a bag.**
- **Emotional**: As emotional beings, people aren’t always capable of expressing themselves clearly. Emotions like anger and sadness can prevent clear communication.
- **Technological**: Have you ever had difficulty understanding someone in a virtual meeting as a result of poor wifi, audio, or video? These are technological barriers

The takeaway here is that there are many barriers that can affect communication. By understanding what barriers, being aware of them, and doing our best to overcome them, we can communicate much more effectively.

# Keys to Excellent Communication

Now that you understand the components of communication and how they work, you have a solid foundation on which you can improve your skills. This section will provide the keys to excellent communication.

## Be a Great Listener

“*Seek first to understand, then to be understood.*”

- Stephen R. Covey

Listening and paying attention to who you’re communicating with is **always** important. Even if you’re the one conveying information, you need to be aware of the receivers of your message. Are they understanding you? Are there any barriers in the way?

Here are some steps to being a great listener:

1. **Give your full attention to the people you’re communicating with**. A common trait among poor communicators is that they’re not actually listening, but rather thinking of what they want to say next. Instead, clear your mind and focus entirely on who is talking so that you can properly decode their message.
2. **Be aware of non-verbal communication**. Body language, facial expressions, and tone of speaking all profoundly affect what’s being communicated. While you listen to people’s words, do not forget to take in their non-verbal communication, as well.
3. **Listen actively** by showing people that you are receiving their message(s). At times, this may mean nodding to show people that you understand what they’re saying. Other times, it helps to repeat someone’s message back to them to confirm.

## Communicate as Simply, Briefly, and Clearly as Possible

When it’s your turn to speak, it’s best to respect and make the most of that time by sending the clearest and simplest message you can.

Steps to follow to achieve this goal include:

1. **Take time when needed to craft your message**. It is totally acceptable to take a moment to prepare your message before you speak. In fact, it’s far better to pause and construct a simple and clear message than it is to start speaking immediately but confuse your listener.
2. **Minimize confusion by condensing your message. The more you say, the bigger the possibility for confusion is. The goal is to say as much as you need to in order to properly express yourself, but not much more.**
3. **Avoid jargon. Choose simple and easy over complicated and hard. Unless you’re communicating with someone whom you are absolutely sure has the same knowledge as you, avoid complex industry-related terms. Similarly, choose the simplest words you can for effective communication; flexing your vocabulary may lead to misunderstandings.**

## Express Yourself with Confidence and Certainty

When we communicate with each other, we tend to gravitate towards confidence and certainty. Imagine this scenario with four friends.

Beth: What should we eat tonight?

Ron: Hm, I don’t know. How about pizza?

Lindsey: Maybe burgers?

Chad: Let’s eat sushi!

While Lindsey and Ron showed uncertainty, Chad expressed himself with confidence. More likely than not, the group will sense Chad’s confidence and likely eat sushi.

Certainty and confidence inspire trust. As long as you are confident in what you’re saying, it’s best to express it with certainty. In fact, this is a quality all great leaders have. If you can express yourself confidently, people will naturally want to follow you.

# Practical Examples of Communication in the Workplace

Now that we’ve established what communication is and how you can communicate effectively, it’s time to explore some practical examples of times when communication is critical in the workplace. In each example, we’ll explore how poor communication leads to difficulties while great communication leads to success.

## Getting the Most out of Relationships with Teammates

As an engineer, your most valuable resources are your teammates. Impaired communication leads engineers to see themselves as lone wolves and hesitate to ask for assistance when they need it.

Effective communication with teammates, on the other hand, strengthens relationships, builds trust, and maximizes results.

- **Open channels of communication with teammates fosters an environment of positivity and collaboration**. When you encounter a problem you’re not sure how to solve, for example, knowing that you can ask teammates for help is a huge benefit.
- **Fresh eyes and fresh perspectives**. With their own unique viewpoints, your teammates will look at your challenges in a different light and possibly offer their own alternative solutions.
- **The advantages of collective knowledge**. Even the most skilled engineer is limited by their own experience. The collective knowledge of a group of individuals will always be greater than the knowledge of any of the individuals in that group.

## Encountering Bugs

Part of being an engineer is running into bugs while trying to develop solutions. Ignoring bugs and not communicating them to others is a recipe for disaster. Instead, any bugs you encounter must be reported to your team and project manager via agreed-upon communication tools, such as email, instant messaging, etc.

The process of clearly documenting bugs should include providing the following information:

- The expected behavior/result and what is occurring.
- All of the steps needed to reproduce the bug, including information like the OS and browser used.
- The impact of the issue on your current development task.
- Possible solutions along with your estimations about their costs and benefits.

Well-documented bugs can then be added to the approrpiate tracking tool (e.g. Trello, Github, Jira, Google doc).

## Delays and Changes

“*The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.*”

- Robert Burns

We wish that all of our tasks and projects went perfectly according to plan, but that’s just not how life works. Every experienced engineer knows that delays and changes are just part of the job.

One of the truths about working as a team is that your work will affect everyone else’s - and their work affects yours, too. When you encounter situations in which you know there will be delays and/or changes, properly communicating these facts is critical.

Aspects of scenarios like this that must be communicated include:

- What changes, specifically are being made? How will they affect the codebase and others’ work?
- Why do you need to make these changes?
- Is there a need or an opportunity for your teammates to provide feedback and/or alternative solutions?
- If there will be a delay, what is your estimation of the new timeframe?
- Do you need assistance?

## Updates

On a daily basis, an effective team is aware of what all its members are working on. For this reason, providing any necessary updates regarding your tasks, workload, and priorities is an important component of being a great team member.

Communicate updates:

- When taking ownership or starting a task.
- When finishing a task earlier than I expected.
- For larger tasks, providing a daily update with an estimated "percentage completed" is helpful.
- When you need to run a build or deployment to an environment.
- When a task is completed and changes are ready for code review
- When a previous decision needs to be changed, such as an API your development team is relying on
- When your availability is changing, including:
    - Short term changes: a doctor’s appointment in the afternoon or taking a Friday off.
    - Long term changes: a leave of absence or vacation.
    - Scheduling changes: splitting time with a separate client.

## Asking Questions and Seeking Clarity

One of the most important skills an engineer can have is the ability to ask the right questions. Asking important questions shows humility, care, and interest in delivering a successful product to the client.

When clarity is lacking in requirements, it is essential to seek clarity rather than make assumptions. If you are not sure that what you are building will 100% fulfill the task's requirements, don't be afraid to ask. Great developers build with the end goal in mind and ask questions about requirements when they are not clear.

Ask questions when:

- You are not 100% sure about the task or a feature you will build.
- If you disagree with the requirements and have suggestions for improvement.
- When the requirements of two different tasks are contradictory.
- When the timeline or deadline doesn't seem achievable.
- If you aren't sure you have sufficient resources (people, tools, equipment) to complete a task.

# Communication Tools and Mediums

When people think of communication, they often picture two people speaking face-to-face. Especially with modern technology, however, communication occurs in a huge number of ways through a number of different tools and mediums.

Especially as an engineer, a helpful distinction to understand about communication tools is between Synchronous and Asynchronous.

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

Synchronous communication happens in real time. When you communicate with someone synchronously, you work together in the moment to exchange ideas. Examples of synchronous communication include face-to-face meetings, phone calls, and video calls.

Asynchronous communication involves gaps of time in between messages. Unlike synchronous communication, participants engaging in asynchronous conversations respond at their convenience. Examples of asynchronous communication include texting, email, and Slack.

Synchronous communication may be preferred for:

- Brainstorming, creativity, and/or free-flow of ideas.
- Team and relationship building.

Asynchronous communication is often better when:

- The people communicating are busy and cannot set aside shared time to meet.
- More time is needed to formulate responses.
- Conversations should be recorded.

With an understanding of this distinction between synchronous and asynchronous communication, we can move forward and discuss specific communication tools and mediums, like meetings.
