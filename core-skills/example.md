## Introduction

## Communication

A big part of our day to day work is about communicating effectively with others. This is extremely important because the overall process of building a product requires harmony between people and a clear understanding of everyone's role in what's being built.

Here are some reasons why effective communication is important:

- Building great software is hard

- It avoids confusion

- It provides purpose

- It creates accountability

- Its save time and eventually money

- Its build trust

Oftentimes, engineers focus only on learning about new technologies and neglect improving their ability to communicate with their co-workers. Achieving the proper balance between technical ability and strong communication skills is the difference between a good developer and a great one.

### Communicating Issues To Teammates

As engineers, we often run into various issues while trying to develop solutions. These issues range from a simple bug, to a piece of code that you need to refactor, or even a potential issue that may occur within the project you are working on.

When you have to communicate an issue, the first thing you should do is clearly document the issue in whatever tool your team is using to keep track of tasks and issues (e.g. Trello, Github, Jira, Google doc). It's best to notify your team and, when applicable, your project manager via an agreed upon communication tool (email, instant messaging platform, etc).

Make sure to include the following points when describing your issue:

1.  The gravity and impact of the issue

2.  All the steps to reproduce it

3.  Possible solutions with their relation between cost vs. benefit

### Communicating Task Delivery Delays

If there's going to be a delay when delivering a task, let your project manager know as soon as possible. Do not wait until the due date to reveal the delay. As soon as you know you're going to be late, figure out why, what you're going to do to prevent that from happening in the future, as well as the new due date.

For example, if you are working with a team that has weekly sprint meetings every Monday to set the tasks you will be working during the week, don't wait until Thursday or Friday to communicate to your team that you won't complete your task. Again, you should communicate with them as soon as you know that you won't be able to deliver the task; then provide the best information you can about the cause of the delay, the expected impact, the probability it will occur, your thoughts about mitigating it, and your worries concerning it.

### Communicating Changes

Be transparent about any changes related to how you go about completing certain tasks if they have the potential of affecting aspects of the codebase that others worked on. For example an integration or some aspect of the product's architecture. When changing components of a system that has a broad impact, make sure that you let others know about such changes, as well as their potential impact, and why you are doing so.

When making big changes, it's easy for something to break. Just make sure you are always on the same page with your team when working through sensitive tasks.

Some examples of when should I communicate changes:

- When I change the scope of my task

- When I'm going to delay the task I'm working on

- When I am working on a part of the product that affects many components (Ex. If you change an API or some aspect of the codebase's architecture)

### Giving Updates

Be proactive and transparent about what you're doing. A lack of communication is where people can find themselves in trouble.

When should I give updates

- When I finish a task earlier than I expected

- When I'm stuck on something I'm doing and I see that there's a potential delay

- When I deploy something to production

### Asking Questions

One of the greatest skills an engineer can have is the ability to ask good questions. It shows that you have humility, that you care, and are truly interested in delivering a successful product to the client.

It's also important not to make assumptions. If you are not sure that what you are building will 100% fulfill the requirements of the task, then ask. Don't make assumptions! Great developers build with the end goal in mind and ask questions about requirements when it is not clear to them.

For example, your project manager or product manager comes up with a new feature that they want to add in the next sprint. In the requirements, they specify third-party integrations and tools you should use. Be sure to ask clarifying questions on why they made those choices. If you have a better solution then you should tell them. Great engineers ask questions and provide their own feedback in a constructive way.

Another situation that might come up is when you are working with a designer, or receive design files to work with. You might have an alternative solution to building a particular screen that considers certain factors the designer wasn't aware of (performance, ease of use, etc). Do not be afraid to bring up your thoughts, questions or concerns to designers or project managers when it comes to the UI/UX of a feature or the project as a whole.

Ask questions when:

- You are not 100% sure about the task or a feature you will build

- If you don't agree with the requirements and have better suggestions

- When requirements between two different tasks are contradictory

### Communication Tools

There are quite a few different tools that can be utilized to communicate with other team members, as well as with clients. Knowing which communication tool will work best in different situations is as important as knowing which IDE works best with different programming languages. Each tool comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, which can aid you in making an informed decision on which tool to use.

#### Email

The old standard! Email revolutionized both the way people communicated at work, and the speed with which they could communicate.Â  With this in mind, here are some best practices and recommendations on when and how to communicate via email.

When to use:

- When you don't need an immediate answer. Email is asynchronous, so the expectation is that you will get a response in the near future.

- When you are asking a more complex question and need a more detailed answer.

- When you wish to provide some detailed information.

- When you want to begin a dialog with multiple people.

What not to do:

- CC people that aren't going to provide any value to the conversation.

- Email signatures with big, goofy images in them (employer required signatures being the exception).

- Don't send a followup too quickly. Send the time to provide a clear, concise, and accurate response.

Advantages:

- Easily searchable

- Archive of project information (assuming your email account remains active, and deleted emails are archived and not purged)

- Universal - Everyone has email!

Disadvantages:

- Slow response time

- Emails can be lost. People may get hundreds in a day and may miss the email you sent.

- Spam - Your email can sometimes get flagged incorrectly, which is incredibly frustrating.

#### Chat/Instant Message Tools

Instant Messaging tools have been around for a while. ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger paved the way for a number of services used throughout the industry today. There are several newer tools that have been designed specifically for business, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, and a host of other tools that support instant messaging, such as Skype, WeChat, Google Hangouts, etc.

When to use:

- When you need a quick response

- When you want to post a question to a group of people (depending on service)

- When you want to begin a conversation among a group of people.

What not to do:

- Don't start a conversation with "hello" and then say nothing until you get a response.

- Don't send

- A bunch

- Of short

- Messages.

Advantages:

- Quick

- Archivable and searchable (depending on the service)

- Informal

- Great for team communication (depending on the service).

- Some support connectivity with external services (like github, Jira, Trello, etc).

- Many support voice and screen sharing functionality.

Disadvantages:

- Potentially distracting

- Depending on the service, a subscription may be required to access all features.

#### Video Conferencing

Video conferencing services have been around for quite a while, and using them has become pretty common in many organizations.

When to use:

- Great for standups.

- When it is important to really see each other.

- Performing interviews (makes sure you hire who you interview).

What not to do:

- Don't waste people's time.

Advantages:

- Makes face to face communication work when people are around the world.

- Many support screen sharing.

- More difficult for people to disengage and multitask.

Disadvantages:

- Requires a pretty solid internet connection.

#### Audio Conferencing

An exceptionally common way for people to carry out meetings, especially when participants are spread across numerous locations.

When to use:

- Anytime you need to gather people together

- When decisions need to be made and issues need to be discussed.

- When seeking multiple opinions on how to resolve an issue.

What not to do:

- Don't waste people's time.

- Keep the meeting on track.

- Don't call a 30 minute meeting with several people just to ask one question (especially when that question could've been answered with an email or instant message).

Advantages:

- Users typically just need a phone to connect.

- People can be away from their computers and still join.

- People are very familiar with meeting this way.

- There are many services that offer both audio and video conferencing solutions.

Disadvantages:

- "Sorry, I was multitasking" - no way to ensure people are engaged.

- Shy individuals may not speak up during the call.

### MeetingÂ 

Meetings can be a great way to connect with your team members, but they must also have a purpose that makes the time spent worthwhile.

Basic rules that you should follow:

- Be on time

- Prepare before the meeting, what you have to say or present

- Be presentable

- While in a meeting, wait until someone finishes speaking before talking

- Ask questions if you have them.

- Pay attention to what others are saying

- Make sure everything is working, audio, microphone, and your internet

- Be respectful

#### Sprint Planning

Sprint planning provides structure, sets expectations and defines the backlog for upcoming sprints. Engineering teams utilize sprint planning to better organize and ensure the success of the sprint. This meeting occurs once per sprint, and is used to address action items, roadblocks, and questions for the upcoming sprints and to seek resolution to blockers from the current or past sprints.

#### Stand-upÂ 

If your team is using an Agile approach, you will have to participate in daily Stand-up meetings. Stand-ups should be short (no more than 15 minutes) and highly focused meetings where developers provide their status on their current task(s). The idea behind the "Stand Up" is that no one wants to stand for all that long, so the quicker everyone gets through their list, the quicker everyone can sit back down.

Questions to answer during the stand-up

- What have you worked on since the last Stand-Up?

- What are you currently working on?

- What will you be working on next (before the next Stand-Up)?

- Is that anything blocking you from completing your task (Optional)

- Request any additional support for your current task (Optional)

- Request time with another developer after the stand-up completes or at a specified time during the day. Do not hijack the Stand-Up.

## Negotiating

## Proactivity

## Adaptability

- Sticky to the conventions

- Sticky to the culture

## WritingÂ 

Despite being developers, we don't exclusively write code. There are times when we find the need to write other kinds of materials; like blog posts, technical documentation, training materials, and detailed outage reports.

What follows are some recommendations and best practices when it comes to writing.

### Blog

Many organizations have blogs on their sites with content written by employees. There are also many developers who have very successful personal blogs discussing any number of technical topics. Below are some general guidelines you should follow when you are putting together a blog as a whole, and writing individual posts for it.

First and foremost, DO NOT PLAGIARIZE! Nothing will discredit your blog quicker than stealing content from somewhere else. With that in mind, researching your topic, quoting references,and citing your sources are not only accepted, but encouraged!

The content of your post should be wholly unique, but you don't have to be the first person to write about a specific topic. Tons of people have written about tips and tricks on SEO, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.

Speaking of SEO, you should definitely take that into consideration when putting your blog together, as well as for each article that is posted to it. Your post should include the proper metadata, a headline containing an attractive and attention grabbing title, as well as optimized keywords. Here is a great checklist for optimizing your blog post: <https://syedbalkhi.com/14-point-blog-post-checklist-to-use-before-you-hit-publish/>

Before you actually start writing anything, be sure to determine the intended audience for not only your blog as a whole, but for each individual post that is authored for it. This will keep your posts focused, topicical, and also helps to engage readers.

When it comes to the actual writing part, there are some fairly obvious writing techniques that you should follow that will improve the quality of your blog. First, be sure to use proper spelling, punctuation, and grammer. This seems obvious, but there are far too many blogs out there that have yet to hear of spell check. Also, don't write in a vacuum. Have others proofread your post prior to publishing in order to improve the overall quality of the post.

You should also be concise. Writing a massive post, filled with tons of personal anecdotes and tangents will kill your blog. If you have a ton to say, you should break it up into smaller chunks within the post, and even make it become multiple blog posts instead of one giant post.

If your goal is to grow a healthy readership, posts should be published on a regular schedule. This is challenging for many individuals, but is necessary. One way to get around this is to write several posts prior to actually launching your blog, so there is always a buffer of upcoming posts. For organizations building a corporate blog, multiple authors within the organization can be assigned writing tasks in order to produce content on a regular schedule.

### Technical MaterialÂ 

Developers are often tasked with creating various forms of technical documentation or user guides, and often this technical material is handed over to clients and end users of the software, so it is important that the materials provided are as well crafted as the code.

Before you begin writing anything, you should determine who your audience is going to be. The documentation you create should be relatable to the intended audience. For example, creating a guide for developers to interact with an API is going to be very different from a guide for non-technical users who need to create a new user account in an application you've created.

You should also write from the perspective of someone who has never used your software before. Take into consideration their anticipated level of technical ability, and their familiarity with using software similar to yours. Coming from that perspective, you'll be better able to recognize the areas where you will need to provide more detailed information.

Another thing to take into account are the use of screenshots. Pictures are worth a thousand words, but if those pictures become out of date (e.g. when an update heavily changes the styles and layout of a website), the client will definitely have words for you, and none of them will be good.

You should also avoid writing in a vacuum. Have others review your work, much like how you would have someone perform a code review on any code you've written. You may also find that many different writers are writing documentation that needs to be merged into one large document. When that is the case, a good idea is to have one person bring these different documents together and focus on ensuring that the tone and writing styles all mesh well together, so it appears that it was written by a single author.

#### Code Comments and Docs Generation

While we are discussing technical documentation, we should definitely bring up the creation of documentation from the code itself. Many modern languages have "Docs" style commenting systems which allow you to generate documentation from classes, methods/functions, etc.

Code should be self documenting, but the creation of these kinds of comments really will help future developers who work with your code, even if you never export the docs from the code.

## Time ManagementÂ 

The reason time management is so hard is because you are fighting with all other things but the thing you should be focusing on. Managing time can be tricky especially if you are a consultant or are working remotely. Here are some ideas to help you manage your time:

- Set up a work schedule (start time, stop time)

- Reserve time for breaks (lunch, a short walk)

- Set up open hours to assist other team members

- Focus on one task at the time

## CareerÂ 

### Keep seeking knowledge
