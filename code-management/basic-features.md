Every Code Management System possesses a common set of features.  Those features include:
- Change history - A detailed record of every change that has been made to a file, including dates, user info, and a message to provide context as to why the change was made.
    - This often includes the ability to compare various versions of a file, which can be useful when tracking when a change was made that introduced a bug.
- Branching & Merging - The ability to create offshoots, called branches, from the central codebase, as well as the ability to merge those branches back into the central codebase.
- Distributed/Remote - Many modern Code Management Systems are designed to run remotely/in the cloud. 
- Integration with IDE’s - While not a feature of the Management Systems themselves, many IDE’s integrate with numerous different systems.
