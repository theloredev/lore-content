Every Code Management System possesses a standard set of features.  Those features include:
- Change history: A detailed record of every change that has been made to a file, including dates, user info, and a message to provide context as to why the change was made.
    - This often includes the ability to compare various file versions, which can be useful when tracking a bug introduced by a code change.
- Branching & Merging - The ability to create offshoots, called branches, from the central codebase, as well as the ability to merge those branches back into the central codebase.
- Distributed/Remote - Many modern Code Management Systems are designed to run remotely/in the cloud. 
- Integration with IDE’s - While not a feature of the Management Systems themselves, many IDE’s integrate with numerous systems.
