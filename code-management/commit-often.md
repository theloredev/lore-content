There are several reasons why you should commit your changes frequently. We all have started developing something, only to find that it isnâ€™t going to work after all. 

- You can easily roll your codebase back to an earlier revision and get back to work by having frequent commits.  
- After you commit changes to a branch, you merge in the source branch, saving you from merge nightmares.
- Finally, you should commit individual features or discrete units of work.
