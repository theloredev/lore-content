There are a number of reasons why you should commit your changes frequently. First, we all have started developing something, only to find that it isnâ€™t going to work out at all. By having frequent commits, you can easily roll your codebase back to an earlier revision and get back to work.  A recommended best practice to get in the habit of is, after you commit changes to a branch, you merge in the source branch.  Doing this will help save you from merge nightmares.

Finally, you should commit individual features or discrete units of work.
