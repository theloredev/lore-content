Pair Programming is a relatively new, agile-centric method for writing code with a partner. Traditionally, it encompasses a “driver” and a “monitor/navigator”; the person writing the code and the partner, coding solutions to problems that are generally trickier to solve single-handedly. 

Many startups and companies have recently picked up the practice, some of them going as far to require an hour of pair programming a day. This is still a developing practice; some companies may still offer resistance to this method.

Pair programming has been shown to decrease bugs by 15%, at the added cost of adding 15% to development time (<https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF>). Whether or not an employer will justify the cost is based on their company culture [insert link to culture section here], as well as development timeline. On a particularly tight timeline, there may be less time allocated to pair programming. Once again, it’s all about being able to adapt to a situation. 

## The Driver

The driver is the programmer in control. They’re the one writing the code, taking the wheel, while taking into account the advice of the navigator. Vocalization is important here, even subtle acknowledgements are fine, as long as the navigator knows that you hear what he/she is saying, even if you need to wait until wrapping up your current thought before implementing or considering the advice given.

## The Navigator

The navigator is the programmer who’s working as the command center; taking in all of the code, the end goal, and current progress, and providing assistance (when needed), questions to improve code and clarity, and suggestions on where to go next. 

As a navigator, the importance of communication is doubled down on; you need to be able to elaborate when needed, but just as importantly, give the driver needed space if they are in the middle of implementing a solution. Take time to offer pauses, and make sure the driver is understanding what you’re saying, and not frantically playing a game of catch-up.
